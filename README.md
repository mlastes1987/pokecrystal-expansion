the GS Ball item, which you can give to Kurt who will give it to you the
next day, and comments that it seems something strange is happening in
Azalea Forest, go there to the shrine and place the GS Ball in it and battle
and/or catch Celebi.

-Gen 6 Exp. Share: Instead of holding the item to help level up one particular mon
each mon not in the battle in the party will recieve a reduced amount of exp after 
each victory, keeping the item in the Key Items pocket.

have shared experience from catching Pokemon.
