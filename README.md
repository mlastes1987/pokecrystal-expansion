This is the start of an expansion to vanilla Pokemon Crystal
to enhance the experience with quality of life features.

Based off the decompilation from https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal

# What this hack will have

(done)Restored GS Ball Celebi event: Activated after defeating the Elite Four
and becoming champion, as soon as you can, visit the Goldenrod Pokemon Center
and the event will start, an aide in the center will come up and give you
the GS Ball item, which you can give to Kurt who will give it to you the
next day, and comments that it seems something strange is happening in
Azalea Forest, go there to the shrine and place the GS Ball in it and battle
and/or catch Celebi.

(done)Gen 6 Exp. Share: Instead of holding the item to help level up one particular mon
each mon not in the battle in the party will recieve a reduced amount of exp after 
each victory, keeping the item in the Key Items pocket.

(done)Get experience from catching Pokemon: Your starter and the rest of your team will
have shared experience from catching Pokemon.

(done)Reusable TMs: All TMs will be reusable.

(done)Tradeback NPC: All trade evolutions, either through trade itself (Machamp, etc) or
through trade holding special items can be done through this fine dude in
Prof. Elm's Lab!

-Running Shoes: Press B to run faster! Thanks to Tom Wang https://github.com/froyomuffin
and Seasick https://github.com/SeasickShore for their sprites.

-Togglable Infinite Repels: Why waste the money?  From Radical Red.

-Show move names for TMs and HMs whether recieving or buying: This will make buying from
the stores a lot easier.

Anything not labeled as (done) is still a work in progress.  More to come!
